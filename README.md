star-chart
==========

A Star Chart for Groups of Kids.

Initially this will be tailored to the needs of our Sunday School class, with the end goal of having it be useful for any class, organization, or group of kids.

We'll start out simple using local storage and simple objects and UI - the bare minimum to get a proof of concept working.
Later we can think about fancy animations, cloud storage, an API, an IOS version, a web app, etc.
